# Context

**The following process is meant to facilitate Call for Proposals via a [proposal template](https://github.com/Polkadot-Heroes/CFPs/issues/new/choose) where members propose topics they would like to hold a session on. If you have a topic request that you would like to learn more about, but not be the one who gives the lesson, please go to the [CFPs: Requests and Ideas category on the discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/Polkadot-Heroes/discussions/categories/cfps-requests-and-ideas) and open a discussion on it.**

Workshops, talks and other forms of knowledge-passing in the Polkadot Developer Heroes program is an important part of the learning experience for members. Besides the Parity team providing various workshops to members to learn through these hands-on sessions, the Program also offers its members the opportunity to showcase teaching skills, and create engaging, informative, and hands-on sessions that cater to developers of all levels interested in building in the Polkadot ecosystem. Members of the program (both Rookies and Heroes) are encouraged to propose workshops that align with their expertise and can benefit the Polkadot developer community. 



## Scope and formats
Through the CFP process, members can propose a wide range of possible topics and formats. The list below is not exhaustive and is meant to provide ideas rather than a strict list, but the common thread is that it needs to be relevant to the Polkadot ecosystem and the members of the Program. Different formats can also be mixed and matched if a series of events is proposed. Duration of the sessions can vary based on the complexity and topic to be covered. 

### Technical workshop or talk
- Examples: Introduction to Substrate FRAME, Building parachains on Polkadot, Security implications for dapp builders, Navigating the Polkadot ecosystem etc.
- The topics covered are geared towards developers, educating about a specific tool or concept. 
- Workshops usually have an interactive component for the audience, whereas a talk would not have that component and is more akin to a presentation. 

### Non-technical workshop or talk
- Example: Agile project management, Lean management, Building a company in the Polkadot ecosystem, Public speaking workshop
- Although topics covered are geared towards developers, they can be wider in scope and theme in order to provide upskilling and educational opportunities in complementary areas for personal and professional development.
- Workshops usually have an interactive component for the audience, whereas a talk would not have that component and is more akin to a presentation.

### Panel discussion
- Example: The future of NFTs in the Polkadot ecosystem, Scaling solutions in Polkadot, DeFi and RWA, etc.
- Comprises a group of experts discussing various aspects of a topic, providing diverse perspectives.
- Often includes a Q&A segment where the audience can interact with the panellists.
- Focuses on sharing insights, debating ideas, and exploring complex issues relevant to the Web3 and Polkadot ecosystem.

### Product demo 
- Involves presenting and demonstrating a new or existing product relevant to the Polkadot community.
- Offers hands-on insights into the product's features, capabilities, and potential use cases.
- Encourages feedback and questions from the audience, fostering engagement and community input.
- Can be tied to a more comprehensive feedback loop and beta testing with members.

### Public mentorship session or office hours
- Example: Career guidance in the Web3 space, Substrate development Q&A, General purpose mentor session with Q&A, Ecosystem team office hours, etc. 
- Involves experienced professionals providing advice, answering questions, and sharing experiences.
- Similar to one-to-one mentorships, these sessions can have specific goals with dedicated mentors or provide general purpose office hours 

### Peer-review session
- Example: Code review of a recent hackathon submission, Architecture design discussion of a new project, Research paper discussions, etc.
- Involves presenting work (like code, project designs, or research) for feedback and constructive criticism from peers. 
- Encourages collaborative learning and knowledge sharing, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
- Focuses on specific technical or conceptual challenges, with an emphasis on practical solutions and community expertise.

### Hero-only session
- Example: Master classes, Feedback for upcoming conference talk, etc. 
- Hero-only sessions can provide an outlet for Heroes to hold sessions where they are seeking advice or feedback from other Heroes

### Joint learning sessions
- Example: Collaborative Study Groups for W3F EdX Courses
- Focuses on a group of members collaboratively engaging in an educational course or learning module.
- Encourages peer-to-peer learning and support, enhancing understanding through group discussions and shared insights

Prerequisites
Explain how participants should prepare for the session as well as detail any materials, resources, or tools participants will need including any technical requirements or infrastructure.




## Evaluation Criteria
The Polkadot Developer Heroes program team will review all submitted proposals on a rolling basis, with a committed SLA of two weeks. All discussions relevant to the proposal will happen within the Github issue, which includes any potential update requests, scheduling and other discussions. 

Evaluation criteria that will be used during the evaluation process can be found below, although it is important to note that these do not form a strict matrix as is with the Hero nomination process.  


### Relevance and alignment with the Polkadot ecosystem
Proposals should be closely related to the Polkadot ecosystem. This includes ensuring the content is pertinent to the interests and needs of the Polkadot developer community, including aspects like blockchain technology, dApp development, and Polkadot-specific tools or concepts. 


### Speaker experience and qualifications
The background, credentials, and experience of the speaker(s) should be evaluated. This involves assessing speaker expertise in the proposed topic, experience in similar workshops or talks, and overall reputation in the relevant field.


### Workshop content and learning objectives
Assessing the comprehensiveness of the topics to be covered, ensuring that the content addresses the needs and interests of the target audience.
The alignment of the content with the stated learning objectives and its potential to provide valuable, practical knowledge to participants will be closely observed.

### Format and Structure 
The proposed format (e.g., workshop, talk, panel discussion) and the structure of the session should be evaluated. This includes how well the format aligns with the sessionâ€™s goals and whether the structure is logical and conducive to learning.

### Session Content and Agenda Clarity 
The clarity and detail of the session content and agenda are important. This includes how well the proposal outlines the topics to be covered, the flow of the session, and the specific objectives and outcomes expected from the session.

### Clarity and completeness of proposal
